# Workday API PowerShell Module

This repository is a fork of the original project by [treestryder](https://github.com/treestryder/powershell_module_workdayapi). I created this fork to develop a personal flavor of the original project.

## Overview

This PowerShell module provides simple methods for accessing the Workday SOAP API.

## Installation

This module requires PowerShell version 4. To install, run the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name WorkdayApi
